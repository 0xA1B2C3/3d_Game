# 3dGame

This project is a discontinued platform game that I worked on during around 9th-10th grade. In process of making it, I learned about vectors, matrices, and read about quaternions.

The C file outlines:

- Loading levels from a text file
- Moving the character (a square)
  - Physics
  - Collision detection (my own technique)
- OpenGL drawing

I took a few code blocks from tutorial sites, so not all the comments and code are my own.
